            “Hiding the pain” is a reference to someone trying to put on a brave
            or happy face despite some sort of internal adversity, be it
            disgust, pain, disappointment, or sadness. As such, many of the
            memes that involve Harold's photos focus on someone trying to smile
            through bad news or to place the character in some sort of
            unfortunate-but-hilarious situation.
